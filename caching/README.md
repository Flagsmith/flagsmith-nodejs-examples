# Flagsmith Node.js example with caching

This is a simple Flagsmith Node.js example that uses node-cache as a way to cache flags and identities with a TTL. This can also be used with other implementations such as Redis, see [here](https://docs.flagsmith.com/v1.0/clients/node#caching-data) for more information.
```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```
