# Flagsmith Node.js example with Local evaluation

In this mode, all flag values are calculated locally, on your server. The Flagsmith SDK includes an implementation of the Flag Engine, and the engine runs within your server environment within the Flagsmith SDK.


**Note that this example requires a **Server-side Environment Key**, you can generate this from your Environment Settings.
